Apply the test-driven development approach to the development of functional-style Haskell.

# Annual income tax in the United Kingdom:
Each individual has a personal allowance, which is an amount of income that is exempt from income tax. A person's taxable income is their annual income minus their personal allowance (to a minimum of zero). The default personal allowance in 2020/2021 is £12,500.

However, for higher earners:
"Your Personal Allowance goes down by £1 for every £2 that your [annual] income is above £100,000. This means your allowance is zero if your [annual] income is £125,000 or above."

Once an individual's taxable income is determined, then income tax is applied as follows:

* Band Name
* Taxable income
* Tax rate

* Basic rate
* £0 to £37,500
* 20%

* Higher rate
* £37,501 to £150,000
* 40%

* Additional rate
* over £150,000
* 45%

Each tax rate only applies to income within that band, not to all earned income. For example, a taxable income of £60,000 is taxed 20% on the first £37,500, and taxed 40% on the remaining £22,500 (which results in £16,500 of tax overall).

Develop Haskell functions for computing an individual's personal allowance and income tax from their annual income.

Utilize Haskell libraries that provide **automated unit-testing** tools.
